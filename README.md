### Design and Implementation Constraints
- Payment System:
The current implementation includes a dummy payment system for transaction simulations. Please note that no actual financial transactions are processed.

- Limited Scraping:
To ensure optimal performance and minimize the impact on external systems, the scraping functionality is limited to a specific section of the BigBasket website. This approach aims to avoid overloading the BigBasket server while still providing competitive pricing information.

- Order Tracking:
The current version of the website does not feature a geolocation-based order tracking system. Please note that the geographical tracking of placed orders is not available at this time.
